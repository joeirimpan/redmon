You can either set\r\nit with an environment variable or by passing it as an argument.\r\n\r\n```\r\nREDMON_TIME_INT=2 redmon monitor -k sample\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nredmon monitor -k sample -i 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nRedmon now watches a key called `sample` every two seconds.\r\n\r\n**Intervals passed as arguments take precedence.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nREDMON_TIME_INT=2 redmon monitor -k sample -i 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nRedmon now watches a key called `sample` every three seconds.\r\n\r\n### Setting expected value\r\n\r\nYou can set an expected value for your monitor, and Redmon will warn you when your\r\nkey is not set to it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nredmon monitor -k sample -t 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, Redmon will watch `sample` and expect its value to be 6. If it is not, Redmon will\r\nprint its value in red.\r\n\r\n## Running Tests\r\nRedmon uses `pytest` to write/run test cases. To run the test cases,\r\n\r\n```\r\n  cd tests\r\n  py.test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo\r\n2. [Clone] (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your newly forked repo\r\n3. Write relevant test cases\r\n4. Raise pull requests to [swaathi/redmon](https://github.com/swaathi/redmon)\r\n\r\n## Coming Up\r\n- Monitor multiple keys\r\n- Set the values your Redis key should be compared against\r\n",
